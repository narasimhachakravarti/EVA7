This Part contains my work on building neural network on manually on excel sheet along with implementation of learning rate

Please find the attached excel sheet for backpropogation

Screen shot attached represents :

    lr_0.1 - > Learning rate with 0.1
    lr_0.2 - > Learning rate with 0.2
    lr_0.5 - > Learning rate with 0.5
    lr_0.8 - > Learning rate with 0.8
    lr_1.0 - > Learning rate with 1.0
    lr_2.0 - > Learning rate with 2.0
